  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues.
  
  You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.
  
  ```
  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
  
  WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repositor
  THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
  
  WHEN I enter my project title
  THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
  
  WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
  THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, and Tests
  
  WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
  THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
  
  WHEN I enter my GitHub username
  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
  
  WHEN I enter my email address
  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

  WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
  THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

  ```
