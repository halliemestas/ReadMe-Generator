  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.
  You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.
  The generator begins by initializing the index.js file via node in the command line. A video example of the application in use is also included. 
  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  Download a copy of the files in the repository, once the download is completed you use the command line to initialize the index.js file.
  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  When the program runs, you will be prompted to answer a series of required questions to generate the ReadMe for your project.
